# Privacy Policy for Tag App

This privacy policy outlines the information that Tag collects, uses, and shares through our app.

---

## Information Collection and Use

The information we collect falls into two categories:

1. Information provided by platforms where the app is hosted (e.g., Apple App Store, Google Play Store), if applicable.  
2. Information provided directly by the Tag app user.

---

### Information Provided by Platform Hosts

If Tag is integrated with a third-party platform, that platform may provide us with access to information about your account, such as basic store or user information. We use this information solely to provide and improve the Tag app experience.

---

### Information Provided by the App User

When a user installs Tag, they may be asked to provide personal details such as their name, phone number, or email address. This data is used to provide the app’s features — including tagging, chatting, and activity tracking — and to improve the overall user experience. We may also store anonymized metadata about user interactions in the app.

---

## Information Sharing and Disclosure

Tag does **not** sell, trade, or rent your personal information to others.

We may:

- Share aggregated, anonymized analytics with partners or advertisers — none of which can identify individuals.  
- Share data with third-party providers (e.g., cloud hosting, SMS gateways, analytics platforms) only as needed to support app functionality. These providers are prohibited from using your data for any purpose beyond the service we request.  
- Disclose personal information only if required by law, to protect our rights, or enforce our policies.

---

## Access to and Control Over Information

Users can request access to, updates of, or deletion of their personal information at any time by contacting us at [hi@gettag.app](mailto:hi@gettag.app). We will respond within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## Security

We take the security of your information seriously. Tag implements industry-standard protections such as:

- End-to-end encryption  
- Secure data storage  
- SSL/TLS for data in transit  
- Role-based access to sensitive data

---

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

Tag may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page. We encourage you to review it regularly to stay informed of any updates.
